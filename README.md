# Image-classification-using-neural-networks
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The goal of this project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images into one of these 10 classes.

The dataset used is CIFAR-10 collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
